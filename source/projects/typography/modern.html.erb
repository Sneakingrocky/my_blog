        <h3>About the style</h3>
        <p>Modern types radical transitional types even further. They are known for being radically abstract, having sharp contrast from thick to thin strokes, abrupt straight and thin serifs, and a vertical axis. </p>

        <h3>Cap-height</h3>
        <p>The cap height refers to the height of a capital letter above the baseline for a particular typeface.</p>

        <h3>X-Height</h3>
        <p>The X-Height is the height of the main body of the lowercase letter (or the height of a lowercase x), excluding its ascenders and descenders. Bodoni has a regular X-Height</p>

        <h3>Base-line</h3>
        <p>The baseline is an invisible line of alignment on which all of the letters sit. Because it is the most stable axis along a line of text it is a great tool for aligning text with images or other text.</p>

    <h2>Font pairing</h2>
    <h3>Finding the perfect match for Bodoni...</h3>
    <p>Let’s be honest, when you’re going to be spending a lot of time with someone you want to make sure that your personalities compliment each other well. The same goes for the type in your projects - they are going to be spending a lot of time together and it’d be ideal for them to hit it off. Let’s pretend that choosing a typefaces pair is like trying to set up a friend with someone that’ll have them at “hello”.

    <h2>The Perfect Match: Futura PT</h2>

        <h3>Why is she the perfect match?</h3>
        <p>When Futura was younger she never imagined that she would fall in love with a serif typeface. While Futura is more of a low contrast, smaller x-height typeface herself, she is able to compliment Bodoni’s width, and weight nicely.</p>
