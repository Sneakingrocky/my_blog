        <h3>About the style</h3>
        <p>Transitional Sans Serif typefaces are also closely related to their serifed typeface ancestors. Again, sans serif refers to the lack of the characters containing a serif. And perhaps the most popular and well known transitonal sans serif font is Helvetica.</p>

        <h3>Cap-height</h3>
        <p>The cap height refers to the height of a capital letter above the baseline for a particular typeface.</p>

        <h3>X-Height</h3>
        <p>The X-Height is the height of the main body of the lowercase letter (or the height of a lowercase x), excluding its ascenders and descenders. Nimbus has a large X-Height</p>

        <h3>Base-line</h3>
        <p>The baseline is an invisible line of alignment on which all of the letters sit. Because it is the most stable axis along a line of text it is a great tool for aligning text with images or other text.</p>

    <h2>Font pairing</h2>
    <h3>Finding the perfect match for Nimbus...</h3>
    <p>Let’s be honest, when you’re going to be spending a lot of time with someone you want to make sure that your personalities compliment each other well. The same goes for the type in your projects - they are going to be spending a lot of time together and it’d be ideal for them to hit it off. Let’s pretend that choosing a typefaces pair is like trying to set up a friend with someone that’ll have them at “hello”.

    <h2>The Perfect Match: Adriane</h2>

        <h3>Why is she the perfect match?</h3>
        <p>If Nimbus wanted to play it safe Adriane would be a pretty good fit for him. Adriane compliments him due to their similar weights, widths, large X-Heights.</p>
