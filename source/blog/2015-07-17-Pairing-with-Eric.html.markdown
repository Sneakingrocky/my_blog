After a long day yesterday it was nice to have a more relaxing day today. I treated myself to Starbucks Chai Tea Latte like I do most Fridays to reward myself for another good week. I had the first part of the day to set up my computer for the internal iOS app that Eric and I would be working on the second portion of the day. I installed the latest version of Xcode, pulled the repos i’d need for the project from Github and started to read documentation on that I thought might be helpful for building the app. I also used this time to work on a few business cards for the London Craftsman.

After a successful week 2 company stand up, Eric and Emmanuel explained the app that the group had been working on - an internal ping pong queue named “Slam”. They then showed me the features that they had already developed.

Although they were eager to jump right into styling I couldn’t help but want to start from the beginning and sketch out a user flow to come up with some additional fun features. Having time to utilize the entire design process and meet tight deadlines is not something that I have been able to do during my apprenticeship so I really wanted to use it for this project.

The guys were very welcoming to the idea of mapping out a user flow so together we started from the beginning creating an enjoyable user-flow chart. We then began fleshing these ideas out more in the form of low fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq Mockups.

We started from the first step the user would take while using the app. This would of course be logging in. We decided that using google authorization would be a good option for 8th Lighters to login and tie themselves to an identity so we could add features such as ranks, stats, and leaderboards.

It was a fun day, we made really good progress on the wireframes and began talks about possible branding ideas. I’m really excited to see this app grow and be used (hopefully soon!).
