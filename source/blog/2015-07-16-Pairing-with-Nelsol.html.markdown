Today I paired with my mentor, Nelsol. Through this experience I was able to truly get a feel of what a normal day for a designer at 8th Light might look like.

Since Nelsol and I were going to be joining the team I worked with yesterday for their iteration planning meeting and design session I caught Nelsol up on the new feature that the team was looking to add based on user input & data. The proposed feature was a search for the App (Global or specific has yet to be decided yet).

After an extended IPM with a client we were eventually able to join the team for the meeting. Mike went through the data and charts with the client, pain points, assumptions we had, and what problems the search feature would solve for the users. An important statistic that he brought up was that the search function would solve an issue that the apps most active users were having - the app having trouble handling so much data at once. Ultimately and our hope being, more users would be utilizing the app in this way in the near feature. For that reason, tackling this problem would benefit our best users as well as our best future users.

The client was great, and even offered a few pain points that we hadn’t thought of. Once we added those to our list we began our design session where each participant, even the clients, were asked to create four drawings in 10 minutes with their ideas for how the search feature should be displayed and how it should function. Through these drawings and exercise we were able think creatively without boundaries and quickly come up with several solutions. We shared these solutions with each other and worked together toward narrowing down the best solution for the search feature.

After the meeting, Nelsol and I worked together on a few client tickets. I was quickly thrown out of my comfort zone when Nelsol said that we would be using VIM as our text editor. I had meant to learn VIM during my apprenticeship but juggling all of my responsibilities pushed that further and further. Even though Nelsol had told me to start learning VIM in my spare time he was very patient with me as I slowly made changes and scrambled to remember each key.

Along with the painful pace at which i moved through the editor I was overwhelmed with the spaghetti code of the project and how the pages were laid out. I would be lying if I said working with this code base didn’t scar me with how many dependencies and redundant lines there were. Thinking positively - it makes me appreciate other projects i’ve worked on or have been able to start from scratch.


>*“Legacy code. The phrase strikes disgust in the hearts of programmers. It conjures images of slogging through a murky swamp of tangled undergrowth with leaches beneath and stinging flies above. It conjures odors of murk, slime, stagnancy, and offal. Although our first joy of programming may have been intense, the misery of dealing with legacy code is often sufficient to extinguish that flame.﻿”-― Michael C.
