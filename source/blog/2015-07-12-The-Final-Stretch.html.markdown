I’ve hit an important milestone of my Design Residency here at 8th Light. I am in my last month of my apprenticeship which means that I will spend the next month trying to show what i’ve learned in the last 5 months and prove that I have what it takes to earn a position as a Design Craftsperson here at 8th Light. It is also an opportunity for me to see what it is like to work with other Craftsman, explore some of our client projects, and to gauge whether it’s truly the right fit.

For the next two weeks I will go on a “Pairing Tour” which means that I will be pairing with a new person every day. I’m really excited to continue to work alongside others as my last month of client work with Emmanuel and Geoff has been such a great experience.

I rolled an amazing group of people for my tour  and review board so I know it’ll be a fun couple of weeks and i’m no doubt going to learn a great deal from each person. I’ll use this fuel the energy I know i’ll need to complete two weeks of challenges following my tour and to prepare for my speech where I’ll most likely turn red thanks to my Irish side.


#####Some goals I have for my tour:

1. Try to get better sleep than I have during my apprenticeship
2. Ask tons of questions
3. Be a good pair who’s engaged in the work
4. Stay positive even if I feel out of my element
5. Blog about each day of my tour
