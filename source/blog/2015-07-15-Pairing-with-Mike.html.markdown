Today I paired with Mike D on an iOS app project. I was excited to work with Mike because we’ve always had great conversations at lunch but I haven’t had the opportunity to work on his project during my apprenticeship. He also did a great job helping out with a group of visitors from Mobile Makers yesterday -- all of the kids were entranced while he talked about his daily activities as one of our main iOS developers.

To start things off Mike took me through the app and all of its current features. We worked through a couple of the support tickets and talked about some of the current user pain points that the team was looking to improve on.

In order to improve upon the app the team has been trying to let user input, data & stats drive their next steps and prioritize which pain points are the most urgent. In order to do this Mike and I began began collecting data & stats from our database. With the data we created charts to better represent the data to our client in our next iteration planning meeting.

This process excited me for a couple reasons. I think its great that the team is making an effort to solve user pain points using data driven design. Going this route will be much more effective than implementing a new feature based on pure assumption. The other thing that excited me was having a team of hardworking developers take part in the design process.

If they have great experience with your product and they have great experiences with your service, they’re going to be passionate about your brand, they’re going to be committed to it. That’s how you build that kind of commitment." –- Jesse James Garrett*
