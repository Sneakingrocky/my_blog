The last day of my pairing tour was a busy one! In the morning I worked on more business cards for London and organizing all of the files for our seperate offices.

After lunch Eric took Nelsol and I through a client project that is looking to improve the user experience and design of their app. As Eric took us through the project I could immediately see things that Nelsol and I could do to make the application more user friendly. I honestly wish that I could design the entire thing from the ground up but that’s not in the cards. I also think this project would benefit greatly by speaking with the users so we could eliminate a lot of the noise and unneeded material within the app.

Going through the app was pretty tiring so Eric and I took a ping pong break to relax before we dove into pairing on SLAM again. After the best, most highly skilled round of ping-pong in the world, Eric and I showed the wireframes we had been working on to the rest of the slammers. They were excited about the proposed features and one thing i’m really glad I did was ask them for ideas that we could add. The guys came up with some really great ideas!

We all then began drafting out more of our ideas, writing up project stories, and breaking up into pairs to knock out some features. Eric and I continued to work on the wireframes and the others began to work on adding Google Authorization to the App.

My pairing session was cut short today because I received my “Challenges”.  Challenges are two weeks of work that will determine whether or not I have a future at 8th Light as a designer. They consist of….just kidding. It’s a secret.
