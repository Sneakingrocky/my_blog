For the majority of my apprenticeship I have been working on my own. However, this week I was able to get some good pairing in with another designer - Cesar Figueroa. One of the things I loved about working with Cesar aside from his great taste in music is his willingness to share all of the cool tools he has gathered over time. Here are some of the cool resources that I took note of:

###caniuse.com

"Can I use" provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.

###tinypng.com

“TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your PNG files.”

###chrome://cache/

The server will tell the browser whether it should cache a page and for long. This is pretty usefl if you need to find a cached version of your website.

###destroyallsoftware.com


Destroy All Software screencasts are short: 10 to 15 minutes, but dense with information.

###thegreatdiscontent.com

The Great Discontent (TGD) is a triannual print publication and online magazine featuring candid interviews with those who create. Focusing on beginnings, creativity, and risk, TGD provides a memorable look into the lives of its subjects via long-form interviews, short features, and film-based projects.
