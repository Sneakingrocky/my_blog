Today I took a trip over to Groupon to pair with Kevin on an Ember.js App. It was a cool field trip and Groupon’s office certainly had a lot going on. Most memorable -- a giant cardboard kitty in a massive spaceship. I’m pretty sure if I were to go there again there would be a 100 things that I missed the first time.

I was nervous to pair on the Ember App because I had planned to go through the Treehouse tutorial the night before but ended up falling asleep with my giant headphones on before I could finish all of the videos. I was more exhausted than I thought! I continued to prepare on the train ride in even though I get motion sick while riding and reading. I guess I was scared that I wouldn’t be able to contribute as much as I had hoped if I didn’t know Ember because I was studying like a college student about to take a final exam. Luckily, Kevin quickly filled me in that he was also just starting with Ember. Feeeeeew!

Together we started drafting out the function of his and Mike’s app on the whiteboard like I always love to do. We then took those ideas, set up our environment and began setting up the static stage & grid for the app. We also started organizing our folder structure to make sure that our CSS was well organized as we built out the project.

It was fun to work alongside Kevin to figure out how to implement Ember’s helpers with the styling that we wished to have. We both took turns driving and paid attention to what each person was doing. This helped a great deal as Kevin was able to catch my mistakes and vice versa. It also helped out a great deal when I was developing on the browser and would accidently save and the auto-reloader would run losing all of my changes.

Before I had to leave for a client meeting Kevin and I were able to add some basic styling, fonts, explore, edit & add some SVG graphics, and brainstorm additional styles they could add later.

I can’t tell you how refreshing it was to be able to start a project from scratch again. After working in webs lately, I truly appreciated getting to work on this project with Kevin.
