          <p>My passion for creating things came at an early age - drawing, painting, building... you name it. It wasn’t until later when I began my journey as a designer that I truly realized the amount of power in how someone interacts with what you create - How do they feel? What do they see? Will they remember it?</p>

          <p>I’ve worked in various parts of the design industry and learned so much along the way. I started out creating digital signage and collateral for big name hotels such as ACME Chicago, Embassy Suites, and Holiday Inn. I worked in printing apparel where I designed, printed, and packaged hundreds of shirts, shoes, etc. a day for various concerts, events, and even the US army.</p>

        <div class="column large-6">
          <p> My love for the tech industry led me to taking a software apprenticeship where I learned how write backend code and became a better designer by learning how to empathize with developers when I design web and mobile applications.</p>

          <p>For the past 3 years, I have worked as a product designer for a software consultancy where I conducted research and interviews, created prototypes and mockups, and implemented my designs with HTML/CSS. Along with working with a variety of clients ranging from small, family-owned startups to Fortune 500 companies, I also had the pleasure of building up our in-house design team.</p>
