        <p class="section__highlight">I have been a designer for over 7 years but first and foremost I am a problem solver. I often find myself tackling the problems that no one else wants to solve, all while being personable and maintaining a sense of humor. It’s this attitude that’s led me on an amazing journey of collaborating and leading teams to build impactful software.</p>

        <p>My passion for creating things came at an early age - drawing, painting, building... you name it. It wasn’t until later when I began my journey as a designer that I truly realized the amount of power in how someone interacts with what you create - How do they feel? What do they see? Will they remember it?</p>

        <p>I’ve worked in various parts of the design industry and learned so much along the way. I started out creating digital signage and collateral for big name hotels such as ACME Chicago, Embassy Suites, and Holiday Inn. I worked in printing apparel where I designed, printed, and packaged hundreds of shirts, shoes, etc. a day for various concerts, events, and even the US army.</p>

        <p>My love for the tech industry led me to taking a software apprenticeship where I learned how to write code. There I became a better designer by learning how to empathize with developers when I design web and mobile applications.</p>

        <p>I've had a blast working for tech companies, helping them solve their internal, product, and user painpoints. Most recently I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://buildout.com/">Buildout</a> as a UX Designer & Product Manager where I collaborated with a small team to design new products from scratch that would provide an end to end solution for Commercial Real Estate Brokerages. This included tools for generating marketing materials, managing their leads, and organizing their back office.</p>
