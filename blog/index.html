          <p>While working on a section of an internal project there was something that was bothering me about the way that I structured everything with static pages. Essentially the section contained an index page which linked to four individual view/team pages. Pretty simple.</p>

          <p>When I was first learning to program in Ruby I remember being so excited to have a working program. I was extremely nervous to show my work to my mentor. And as we went through my code she was very patient and told me that she could tell I worked hard on it. It meant so much - and honestly was great fuel to keep me excited about programming.</p>

          <p>A few months ago a friend said something to me that I silently found offensive. He stated that I was a “people pleaser”. I couldn’t exactly pinpoint why this stuck with me so much… I mean how is wanting to make people happy a bad quality? If more people went out of their way to make others happy wouldn’t that make the world be a better place?</p>

          <p>When I first started working with images way back when, I would save them as a jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group). The problem with saving an image as a jpeg is it has a “lossy” file compression. This means that data is lost as the file is compressed which causes a noticeable loss of quality. When I discovered this, you can imagine how cool I felt when I started saving my images and graphics as png’s (Portable Network Graphics) -  which are “lossless”. A file type that does not lose data so that it can be viewed at a high quality resolution seemed like the end all solution for web images and graphics.</p>

          <p>Visual hierarchy is vital in every design in order to create an enjoyable user experience. Good visual hierarchy is the responsible use of color, contrast, texture, shape, position, orientation, and size to create different levels of relative importance. It’s a difficult task to responsibly use all of these exciting tools to create a cohesive and  enjoyable experience for the user. However, with a better understanding of how our users perceive the information we provide them, we’ll have more guidance as to how to efficiently guide our viewers from one piece of content to the next.</p>

          <p>For the first 20 years of my life when someone would tell me that they were interested in learning a new language I would immediately think that they were talking about a foreign language. But in the past year, hanging around people who are passionate about programming and web development, “learning a new language” has a whole new meaning.</p>

          <p>This week my mentor asked me to think about my process while creating a project. He brought up the importance of being ready to defend your work and design decisions when presenting to clients. I was really glad that he brought up this topic because being able to defend your work is such an important skill to have and to actively think about.</p>
