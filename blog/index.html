            <p>I’ve hit an important milestone of my Design Residency here at 8th Light. I am in my last month of my apprenticeship which means that I will spend the next month trying to show what i’ve learned in the last 5 months and prove that I have what it takes to earn a position as a Design Craftsperson here at 8th Light. It is also an opportunity for me to see what it is like to work with other Craftsman, explore some of our client projects, and to gauge whether it’s truly the right fit.</p>

            <p>Before learning anything about programming I used to thing that programmers were nerdy magical beings who had a massive file system of programming tricks up their sleeves. I soon figured out that programmers are master-expert googlers and most of the time they know how to solve a problem because they were once stuck on it themselves. Over the past year i've become more nerdy, and hopefully awesome? Here's a list I keep in my notes section of problems I have run into:</p>

            <p>For the majority of my apprenticeship I have been working on my own. However, this week I was able to get some good pairing in with another designer - Cesar Figueroa. One of the things I loved about working with Cesar aside from his great taste in music is his willingness to share all of the cool tools he has gathered over time. Here are some of the cool resources that I took note of:</p>

            <p>While working on a section of an internal project there was something that was bothering me about the way that I structured everything with static pages. Essentially the section contained an index page which linked to four individual view/team pages. Pretty simple. </p>

            <p>Last October while in the last month of my student software apprenticeship I really struggled with the decision of whether to continue to learn software development or to jump back into my designer shoes. I enjoyed the complex problems of programming but really missed the design side of problem solving. And even though I have always believed that one doesn’t have to choose between design and development I truly felt that I had to make a choice. And I did. Because to be honest - as a beginner of anything you have to stay focused on the thing you want to perfect. If you’re jumping around too much too early on you’re going to know a lot of things but you’ll never be a master at anything.</p>

            <p>When I was first learning to program in Ruby I remember being so excited to have a working program. I was extremely nervous to show my work to my mentor. And as we went through my code she was very patient and told me that she could tell I worked hard on it. It meant so much - and honestly was great fuel to keep me excited about programming. </p>

If more people went out of their way to make others happy wouldn’t that make the world be a better place?</p>

            <p>When I first started working with images way back when, I would save them as a jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group). The problem with saving an image as a jpeg is it has a “lossy” file compression. This means that data is lost as the file is compressed which causes a noticeable loss of quality. When I discovered this, you can imagine how cool I felt when I started saving my images and graphics as png’s (Portable Network Graphics) -  which are “lossless”. A file type that does not lose data so that it can be viewed at a high quality resolution seemed like the end all solution for web images and graphics.</p>

            <p>Visual hierarchy is vital in every design in order to create an enjoyable user experience. Good visual hierarchy is the responsible use of color, contrast, texture, shape, position, orientation, and size to create different levels of relative importance. It’s a difficult task to responsibly use all of these exciting tools to create a cohesive and  enjoyable experience for the user. However, with a better understanding of how our users perceive the information we provide them, we’ll have more guidance as to how to efficiently guide our viewers from one piece of content to the next. </p>
