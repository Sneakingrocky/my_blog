            <p>The last day of my pairing tour was a busy one! In the morning I worked on more business cards for London and organizing all of the files for our seperate offices.</p>

            <p>Today was my second day pairing with my mentor, Nelsol. We started off the day working on some print collateral for a client. I’m very comfortable working with the Adobe Creative Suite and print materials so this project was right up my alley. The downer was that we were on a tight deadline so I tried my best to keep composure, remain calm, and have fun regardless of the tight deadline.</p>

            <p>Today I took a trip over to Groupon to pair with Kevin on an Ember.js App. It was a cool field trip and Groupon’s office certainly had a lot going on. Most memorable – a giant cardboard kitty in a massive spaceship. I’m pretty sure if I were to go there again there would be a 100 things that I missed the first time.</p>

            <p>After a long day yesterday it was nice to have a more relaxing day today. I treated myself to Starbucks Chai Tea Latte like I do most Fridays to reward myself for another good week. I had the first part of the day to set up my computer for the internal iOS app that Eric and I would be working on the second portion of the day. I installed the latest version of Xcode, pulled the repos i’d need for the project from Github and started to read documentation on that I thought might be helpful for building the app. I also used this time to work on a few business cards for the London Craftsman.</p>

I was excited to work with Mike because we’ve always had great conversations at lunch but I haven’t had the opportunity to work on his project during my apprenticeship. He also did a great job helping out with a group of visitors from Mobile Makers yesterday – all of the kids were entranced while he talked about his daily activities as one of our main iOS developers.</p>

            <p>I’ve hit an important milestone of my Design Residency here at 8th Light. I am in my last month of my apprenticeship which means that I will spend the next month trying to show what i’ve learned in the last 5 months and prove that I have what it takes to earn a position as a Design Craftsperson here at 8th Light. It is also an opportunity for me to see what it is like to work with other Craftsman, explore some of our client projects, and to gauge whether it’s truly the right fit.</p>

            <p>Before learning anything about programming I used to thing that programmers were nerdy magical beings who had a massive file system of programming tricks up their sleeves. I soon figured out that programmers are master-expert googlers and most of the time they know how to solve a problem because they were once stuck on it themselves. Over the past year i've become more nerdy, and hopefully awesome? Here's a list I keep in my notes section of problems I have run into:</p>

One of the things I loved about working with Cesar aside from his great taste in music is his willingness to share all of the cool tools he has gathered over time. Here are some of the cool resources that I took note of:</p>

            <p>Last October while in the last month of my student software apprenticeship I really struggled with the decision of whether to continue to learn software development or to jump back into my designer shoes. I enjoyed the complex problems of programming but really missed the design side of problem solving. And even though I have always believed that one doesn’t have to choose between design and development I truly felt that I had to make a choice. And I did. Because to be honest - as a beginner of anything you have to stay focused on the thing you want to perfect. If you’re jumping around too much too early on you’re going to know a lot of things but you’ll never be a master at anything.</p>

And as we went through my code she was very patient and told me that she could tell I worked hard on it. It meant so much - and honestly was great fuel to keep me excited about programming.</p>

            <p>A few months ago a friend said something to me that I silently found offensive. He stated that I was a “people pleaser”. I couldn’t exactly pinpoint why this stuck with me so much… I mean how is wanting to make people happy a bad quality? If more people went out of their way to make others happy wouldn’t that make the world be a better place?</p>

            <p>When I first started working with images way back when, I would save them as a jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group). The problem with saving an image as a jpeg is it has a “lossy” file compression. This means that data is lost as the file is compressed which causes a noticeable loss of quality. When I discovered this, you can imagine how cool I felt when I started saving my images and graphics as png’s (Portable Network Graphics) -  which are “lossless”. A file type that does not lose data so that it can be viewed at a high quality resolution seemed like the end all solution for web images and graphics.</p>

            <p>Visual hierarchy is vital in every design in order to create an enjoyable user experience. Good visual hierarchy is the responsible use of color, contrast, texture, shape, position, orientation, and size to create different levels of relative importance. It’s a difficult task to responsibly use all of these exciting tools to create a cohesive and  enjoyable experience for the user. However, with a better understanding of how our users perceive the information we provide them, we’ll have more guidance as to how to efficiently guide our viewers from one piece of content to the next.</p>
