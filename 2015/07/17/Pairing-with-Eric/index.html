        <div class="article-body"><p>After a long day yesterday it was nice to have a more relaxing day today. I treated myself to Starbucks Chai Tea Latte like I do most Fridays to reward myself for another good week. I had the first part of the day to set up my computer for the internal iOS app that Eric and I would be working on the second portion of the day. I installed the latest version of Xcode, pulled the repos i’d need for the project from Github and started to read documentation on that I thought might be helpful for building the app. I also used this time to work on a few business cards for the London Craftsman.</p>

<p>After a successful week 2 company stand up, Eric and Emmanuel explained the app that the group had been working on - an internal ping pong queue named “Slam”. They then showed me the features that they had already developed.</p>

<p>Although they were eager to jump right into styling I couldn’t help but want to start from the beginning and sketch out a user flow to come up with some additional fun features. Having time to utilize the entire design process and meet tight deadlines is not something that I have been able to do during my apprenticeship so I really wanted to use it for this project.</p>

<p>The guys were very welcoming to the idea of mapping out a user flow so together we started from the beginning creating an enjoyable user-flow chart. We then began fleshing these ideas out more in the form of low fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq Mockups.</p>

<p>We started from the first step the user would take while using the app. This would of course be logging in. We decided that using google authorization would be a good option for 8th Lighters to login and tie themselves to an identity so we could add features such as ranks, stats, and leaderboards.</p>

<p>It was a fun day, we made really good progress on the wireframes and began talks about possible branding ideas. I’m really excited to see this app grow and be used (hopefully soon!).</p>
