<p>The last day of my pairing tour was a busy one! In the morning I worked on more business cards for London and organizing all of the files for our seperate offices.</p>

<p>After lunch Eric took Nelsol and I through a client project that is looking to improve the user experience and design of their app. As Eric took us through the project I could immediately see things that Nelsol and I could do to make the application more user friendly. I honestly wish that I could design the entire thing from the ground up but that’s not in the cards. I also think this project would benefit greatly by speaking with the users so we could eliminate a lot of the noise and unneeded material within the app.</p>

<p>Going through the app was pretty tiring so Eric and I took a ping pong break to relax before we dove into pairing on SLAM again. After the best, most highly skilled round of ping-pong in the world, Eric and I showed the wireframes we had been working on to the rest of the slammers. They were excited about the proposed features and one thing i’m really glad I did was ask them for ideas that we could add. The guys came up with some really great ideas!</p>

<p>We all then began drafting out more of our ideas, writing up project stories, and breaking up into pairs to knock out some features. Eric and I continued to work on the wireframes and the others began to work on adding Google Authorization to the App.</p>

<p>My pairing session was cut short today because I received my “Challenges”.  Challenges are two weeks of work that will determine whether or not I have a future at 8th Light as a designer. They consist of….just kidding. It’s a secret.</p>
