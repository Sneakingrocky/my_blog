        <div class="article-body"><p>Today I paired with Mike D on an iOS app project. I was excited to work with Mike because we’ve always had great conversations at lunch but I haven’t had the opportunity to work on his project during my apprenticeship. He also did a great job helping out with a group of visitors from Mobile Makers yesterday – all of the kids were entranced while he talked about his daily activities as one of our main iOS developers.</p>

<p>To start things off Mike took me through the app and all of its current features. We worked through a couple of the support tickets and talked about some of the current user pain points that the team was looking to improve on.</p>

<p>In order to improve upon the app the team has been trying to let user input, data &amp; stats drive their next steps and prioritize which pain points are the most urgent. In order to do this Mike and I began began collecting data &amp; stats from our database. With the data we created charts to better represent the data to our client in our next iteration planning meeting.</p>

<p>This process excited me for a couple reasons. I think its great that the team is making an effort to solve user pain points using data driven design. Going this route will be much more effective than implementing a new feature based on pure assumption. The other thing that excited me was having a team of hardworking developers take part in the design process.</p>
