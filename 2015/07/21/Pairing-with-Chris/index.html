        <div class="article-body"><p>Today I was able to step back into my comfort zone as a designer. I worked with Chris on the same application that I was working on with Malcolm &amp; Craig yesterday. I was excited to fix up some of the unstyled work that I saw yesterday that needed some love.</p>

<p>After our team stand-up Chris showed me a page that he had worked on the day before. He had already put together some great styles that we could carry into the forms, lists, buttons, etc for our current page. He also showed me the grid that he had made and was testing out based off of the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention. Since CSS can quickly become a spaghetti mess with hot glue instead of spaghetti sauce, the designers at 8th Light and conscientious designers everywhere are constantly testing and looking to create maintainable CSS with limited dependencies. It was cool to see how Chris was trying to make improvements to his code by carrying these conventions into his grid.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, today we felt the pain of environmental issues which cut into our work time a great deal. This is just something that one has to except on a big project with many developers, and conflicting requests. This is something that my mentor has constantly reminded me of - things may not go as smoothly as your optimistic selves may think things will go. As a consultant you have to account for things going terribly wrong or you’re going to find yourself scrambling to meet an unrealistic deadline.</p>

<p>One of our developers on the team kindly helped us move past the environment &amp; project road blockers. Sadly, now Chris’s auto-reloader which was speeding up his workflow was unsupported so we had to find a workaround to bring it back. Once we got through the set-up, Chris and I were able to implement our design changes and brainstorm some design improvements to 8th Light’s SCNA conference website.</p>

<p>Working with different designers, I have found that each one has their own workflow preferences. For example, some prefer to develop in the browser as where others preferred making several changes in their editors and then seeing them all at once. A similarity that I have seen… VIM. Although, Microsoft visual studio did not allow for VIM Chris found a plug-in that him and the developers were able to use to speed up their workflow. Things still weren’t perfect, but today I learned that that comes with each client project having a different environment. Craftsman have to be comfortable being uncomfortable and willing to work with what they are given.</p>
