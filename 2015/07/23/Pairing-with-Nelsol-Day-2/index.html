        <div class="article-body"><p>Today was my second day pairing with my mentor, Nelsol. We started off the day working on some print collateral for a client. I’m very comfortable working with the Adobe Creative Suite and print materials so this project was right up my alley. The downer was that we were on a tight deadline so I tried my best to keep composure, remain calm, and have fun regardless of the tight deadline.</p>

<p>Our workflow was constantly broken up with client meetings, messages from other project members, and questions from internal members. We worked together to stay on task and once we were comfortable with the print we sent it to the client and the printer to get their feedback.</p>

<p>While awaiting feedback we jumped right into some tickets for one of our clients. We worked through some tough problems because the code base was drowning in dependencies. Trying our best to use our principles and keep the code as clean as possible we completed the tickets.</p>

<p>One of the most helpful things that Nelsol showed me today was his workflow. The man is extremely organized and to be honest with how many things he has to juggle it would be a nightmare if he wasn’t. First, he took me through the process of submitting a ticket to be reviewed before a pull request can be requested. He then showed me the clients tracking system for each feature and how ownership is passed from person to person throughout the process. Because ownership is constantly changing, Nelsol has his own way of tracking his work on various projects. He uses trello.com, a free organization tool for teams and individuals.</p>

<p>Lesson of the day: Be Organized!</p>
