<p>Today I paired with Kyle, 8th Light’s writer. Although we didn’t write a single line of code together I learned a lot about all of the hard work Kyle does behind the scenes to make 8th Light a special place.</p>

<p>To start off our day Kyle and I worked on reviewing and editing a blog post submission by another Craftsman. 8th Light encourages their employees to write and talk about their passions, technical, and non-technical topics. Sometimes its not always easy for people to express their thoughts into a cohesive blog or talk. That is where Kyle comes in to help everyone produce something they can feel proud of by making sure the flow of the piece makes sense and that grammatical errors are obsolete.</p>

<p>Another project that Kyle has been working on is bringing back and improving company “Stand Up.” Stand Up is a time where everyone in the company comes together to talk about the projects that they are working on, and any successes or failures that they may have had. This helps everyone in the company stay informed about the company's progress and what their colleagues  have been working on. Last week Kyle did a great job putting together “Stand Up” and acting as MC. In order to keep on improving “Stand Up” Kyle and I went through the feedback form responses that he received and brainstormed some fun ideas with our VP of Sales &amp; Marketing. After our meeting I worked on implementing a few graphs for the blog post about “Stand Up” that Kyle was going to send out to share the feedback results and Kyle multitasked on a few of the things on his list of things to do. I couldn’t help but get the feeling that Kyle does 100 things at once. Somehow he’s able to have a sense of humor through all of his tasks which is really refreshing.</p>

<p>Here are the graphs I worked on creating today:</p>
