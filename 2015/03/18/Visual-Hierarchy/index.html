      <div class="article-body"><p>Visual hierarchy is vital in every design in order to create an enjoyable user experience. Good visual hierarchy is the responsible use of color, contrast, texture, shape, position, orientation, and size to create different levels of relative importance. It’s a difficult task to responsibly use all of these exciting tools to create a cohesive and  enjoyable experience for the user. However, with a better understanding of how our users perceive the information we provide them, we’ll have more guidance as to how to efficiently guide our viewers from one piece of content to the next.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-humans-view-information">How do humans view information?</h3>

<p>In the 1920s German psychologists created theories in order to describe the capability of our brains to generate and organize visual elements into groups or “unified wholes”. This branch of study is called Gestalt psychology and a major part of this study involves the theory of the gestalt effect. The gestalt effect contains a few principles that explain the reasoning behind why our brains are naturally able to categorize information: grouping similar visual elements and organizing them into meaningful patterns.</p>

<p>A few principles of the gestalt effect are:</p>

<p><strong>Law of Similarity:</strong> When things are similar, the human brain tends to perceive them as a group or pattern. Therefore, something different from the group will tend to stand out.</p>

<p><img alt="similarity_example" src="/images/blog/hierarchy/similarity-2c0ccf74.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Law of Continuation:</strong> Continuation occurs when the eye is naturally compelled to move through one object to another object. Elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on a line or curve.</p>

<p><img alt="continuation_example" src="/images/blog/hierarchy/continuation-7d619156.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Law of Closure:</strong> This is a really cool one. This occurs when the human brain is able to fill in missing information in order to create a whole.</p>

<p><img alt="closure_example" src="/images/blog/hierarchy/closure-692a4c9c.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Law of Proximity:</strong> When elements are placed in close proximity the brain tends to categorize them into a group as where things that are placed further apart from each other are viewed as  separate groups.</p>

<p><img alt="proximity_example" src="/images/blog/hierarchy/proximity-b12d3d11.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Figure and Ground Relationships:</strong> This is the brains ability to create a relationship between the object and its background.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-gestalt-theory-help-us">How does the gestalt theory help us?</h3>

<p>A big take away from the principles of the gestalt effect theory is that humans see everything in terms of relationships. With this information designers can apply the gestalt principles to basic design principles such as contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity to communicate better with their users.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-hierarchy-created">How is hierarchy created?</h3>

<p>Hierarchy is created by changing the visual weight of each element. Something with more visual weight is considered higher in the ranks of hierarchy which means that something with less visual weight is less important. Visual weights can be controlled through the use of:</p>

<p><strong>Contrast</strong></p>

<p>Contrast is using the difference in visual properties to make things distinguishable from each other. Shifts in color, size, shape, and position can help create a sense of visual hierarchical importance.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong></p>

<p>Elements that are larger in size carry more visual weight. That being said, the most important elements of your design should be bigger and the least important elements should be smaller.</p>

<p><strong>Color</strong></p>

<p>Bold, contrasting colors can call attention to an element and raise its importance in a design. It can also be used as a hierarchy organizational tool in something such as infographic. The value (the darkness and lightness of an element can also give it more or less visual weight).</p>

<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>

<p>Proximity separates elements from each other and creates sub-hierarchies. Items that are packed closely together create a dense area and therefore create more visual weight.</p>

<p><strong>Repetition</strong></p>

<p>Repetition instantly attaches meaning to elements and communicates that elements are at the same level in the hierarchy. An example of this would be a human knowing that something is a link because they are all styled the same throughout the website.</p>

<h3 id="pulling-it-all-together">Pulling it all together</h3>
<p>Whenever you are working on a project it is important to know what your goals are. What are you trying to communicate to the viewer? Which information needs to be prioritized? When you have your design, ask yourself whether or not there is a nice visual flow from one piece of content to the next. While drafting, if literally numbering your pieces of content in order of importance helps - go for it! If you’re having trouble, try standing back and viewing your design while squinting in order to see what pops out to you first. Is it the content that you numbered 1? If yes, move on to see if the rest of the numbers follow sequentially. If no, you’ll need to play around with your visual weight tools a little more. And once you’re done creating a visual hierarchy masterpiece be sure to celebrate!</p>
