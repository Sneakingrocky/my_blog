      <div class="article-body"><p>This week my mentor asked me to think about my process while creating a project. He brought up the importance of being ready to defend your work and design decisions when presenting to clients. I was really glad that he brought up this topic because being able to defend your work is such an important skill to have and to actively think about.</p>

<h4 id="my-process">My Process</h4>
<p>When I design I like to make decisions based on research - data driven design and user testing when possible. I am old fashioned in some ways because I still love putting things down on paper and sometimes find that by stepping away from the computer I can come up with better and more unique ideas. I believe that brainstorming, wireframing, and prototyping are very important to my design process. These simple tools &amp; strategies are both cost &amp; time effective because you gain a way better grasp of the project than you would trying to dive right into creating the final product.</p>

<h4 id="learning-from-your-mistakes">Learning from your mistakes</h4>
<p>Over time I have definitely fallen victim to creating something that is visually appealing only to have it not be the best solution for the purpose it is being used for. Or even worse, creating a project and not looking at it from every angle only to find out during the undergraduate critique that from a certain distance my project looked like it contained a giant Nazi sign. Yes this happened and I was extremely embarrassed. I’m thankful for moments like these that I was able to crash and burn safely in undergrad because they shaped me into the designer that I am today. I believe that every design decision you make should be purposely made.  And throughout the creative process you should constantly be looking at your work with a critical eye as well as have others view your project.</p>

<h4 id="know-your-clients-goals">Know your clients goals</h4>
<p>When dealing with a client it’s important to try to make the client’s company and project goals as transparent as possible. This will aid in the creative process because you will always have something to refer to:
“Will this design decision help reach my client’s goals?” Knowing your client’s goals will also help you approach things from an angle that they may not have thought of. And being able to directly relate your decision to the client’s goals is a very powerful weapon to have when it comes time to defend your work.</p>

<h4 id="defending-your-design-decisions">Defending your design decisions</h4>
<p>Defending yourself can be extremely tricky in the professional world. Sometimes you are speechless and caught off guard, you strongly disagree with an opposing side, or your emotions just get the best of you and all composure is lost — <em>Flips table</em>. This is where actively thinking about your design decisions during your process can help you think fast on your feet because you are aware and confident about exactly WHY you did something. I find that one of the best ways to defend myself is to understand the other viewpoints. This approach is very helpful because it shows that I understand their thoughts and ideas, but maybe most importantly i’m not making their opinions seem inferior.</p>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h4>
<p>It’s important for everyone to be able to have full confidence in their work, but it is also always important to remember that not all battles can be won. Sometimes you just have to accept that with grace. I promise you one thing though — you will feel much better defending your design decisions proudly than you would be questioning your decisions or even your skills as a professional.</p>
