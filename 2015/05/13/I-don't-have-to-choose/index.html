      <div class="article-body"><p>Last October while in the last month of my student software apprenticeship I really struggled with the decision of whether to continue to learn software development or to jump back into my designer shoes. I enjoyed the complex problems of programming but really missed the design side of problem solving. And even though I have always believed that one doesn’t have to choose between design and development I truly felt that I had to make a choice. And I did. Because to be honest - as a beginner of anything you have to stay focused on the thing you want to perfect. If you’re jumping around too much too early on you’re going to know a lot of things but you’ll never be a master at anything.</p>

<p>So I chose design and starting over from square one. It wasn’t easy. And truthfully I was burnt out from living and breathing software for four months.  But I knew what I wanted, and I was ready to work for it.</p>

<p>Since being accepted as a design resident I have tried to implement some of the principles that I learned while I was a software student. Trying to get something to work, be visually appealing, responsive, and look clean under the hood hasn’t been an easy task. I still have a lot of work to do because essentially every problem i’m tackling is something that i’m tackling for the very first time. That doesn’t bother me so much. Maybe the thing that bothers me the most is continually being road blocked by something that is “developer territory”. It seems acceptable around here for a designer to wait for that roadblock to be cleared by a developer. I don’t want to be road blocked. I don’t want to accept that something is as good as it can get because I don’t know the solution right then or am not required to know the solution. </p>

<p>I think i’m at the point where I can start to join my passion for both design and development without getting too overwhelmed. I’m excited!</p>
