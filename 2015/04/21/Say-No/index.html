      <div class="date">Apr 21 2015</div>

      <div class="article-body"><p>A few months ago a friend said something to me that I silently found offensive. He stated that I was a “people pleaser”. I couldn’t exactly pinpoint why this stuck with me so much… I mean how is wanting to make people happy a bad quality? If more people went out of their way to make others happy wouldn’t that make the world be a better place?</p>

<p>Last week I learned a valuable lesson: Everyone needs to be able to say no. And people pleasing doesn’t always just mean making others happy - it can also mean sacrificing your health &amp; happiness.</p>

<p>To make a long story short I was asked to take on several tasks - some which should not have been my responsibility. Knowing I had a lot on my plate I still took on more responsibilities than I should have.</p>

<p>I was able to accomplish all of the tasks but that came with a lot of stress and little sleep. I should have stood my ground and said no. That would have been the professional thing to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Saying “yes” too much could jeopardize more than just your patience. Taking on more than you’re capable could result in illness or burning out. When you become sick, it’s a struggle to help yourself, much less everyone around you, so cut your losses and say “no” for the sake of your health.”</em></p>
