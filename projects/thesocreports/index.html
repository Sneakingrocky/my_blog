    <div class="details">My Role: Project Manager & Lead Designer</div>

      <p>When TheSocReports came to<a href="https://8thlight.com/"> 8th Light</a>, they presented us with a few challenges. Their number one pain point was manually having to create a 15 - 30 page content rich pdf report per client every single week. Their hope was to automate this process in order to scale their business and reach new markets. In order to reach new markets, they also wanted to create a marketing website that was representative of their brand and voice. But, perhaps the biggest challenge was maintaining Carol’s voice &#38; personal touch in the platform that she was capturing through the manual process in which she was curating and creating each and every page of her client’s reports. We were ready for the challenge, and excited to work with such passionate clients.</p>

    <h2 class="section__title"><span class="section__number">02.</span> The Discovery</h1>
    <p>In order to dive deeper into the existing product, I led a Discovery session with the client where we all took some time to write out features/thoughts on the current product, and the dreams of what the platform would include using a rendition of the <a href="http://www.innovationgames.com/prune-the-product-tree/">Product Tree exercise</a>. After about 10 minutes of writing our individual ideas down we started mapping out our featurelist/wishlist on a product tree placing needs toward the center of the tree and wants toward the edges. We also made sure to group cards that were similar.</p>

    <p>This session was valuable in so many ways. Firstly, it helped build a great foundation for us all to work well together to tackle the tough weeks to come. Secondly, it helped us prioritize and establish what we call <a href="http://www.brighthubpm.com/project-planning/5161-what-is-a-project-charter/">“Charters”</a> so we could get organized and have a plan of attack from the start.</p>

        <p>After the discovery, the team felt we had a clear picture of the client needs but we really wanted to dive into the user needs to make sure we were creating a product that TheSocReport users would both find value in and love.</p>

        <p>We began by researching the target markets, social media platforms, and potential competitors. We then mapped out our objectives and hypotheses.</p>

        <h2 class="section__subtitle">Methods &#38; Conduct</h2>
        <p>We knew we had a limited amount of time and budget to conduct research, so we did so efficiently and effectively by interviewing 5 current users of the TheSocReports.</p>

      <div class="column large-3">
        <h2 class="section__subtitle">Synthesize</h2>
        <p>The information we found during the interviews was invaluable in our design decision process, driving the content creation for the site,  and helping the team make tough business decisions.</p>

    <h2 class="section__title"><span class="section__number">05.</span> The Outcome</h1>
    <p>The team worked long and hard to put together the marketing website and build out the platform in time for a conference. As with any startup things are moving quickly and therefore the team has to be able to pivot quickly as well. TheSocReport team has worked very hard to get more exposure and find users that they can help.</p>
