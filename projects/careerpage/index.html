      <p>Since the dawn of <a href="https://8thlight.com/">8th Light's </a> existence it has hired exclusively through its apprenticeship program.

What we were finding was that candidates were still constantly emailing questions regarding the apprenticeship program, what position was right for them, and what a career at 8th Light looks like. </p>
